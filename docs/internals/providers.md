# Provider architecture

> For maintainers. Using T3 Code? See [docs/user](../user/).

A provider is the agent runtime that does the actual work. T3 Code supports several, and the
orchestration layer does not know which one is behind a thread.

## Built-in drivers

[`builtInDrivers.ts`][drivers] exports `BUILT_IN_DRIVERS` with five entries:

| Driver kind   | Driver source                           |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `codex`       | [`Drivers/CodexDriver.ts`][codex]       |
| `claudeAgent` | [`Drivers/ClaudeDriver.ts`][claude]     |
| `cursor`      | [`Drivers/CursorDriver.ts`][cursor]     |
| `grok`        | [`Drivers/GrokDriver.ts`][grok]         |
| `opencode`    | [`Drivers/OpenCodeDriver.ts`][opencode] |

Each driver declares its `driverKind`, a `configSchema`, and a `create` function that builds an
adapter in a child scope. Adapter implementations live beside them in
`apps/server/src/provider/Layers/` (`CodexAdapter.ts`, `ClaudeAdapter.ts`, and so on) and conform to
[`ProviderAdapter.ts`][adapter]. Read the driver plus its adapter to see how a specific agent's
transport, config, and event shapes are mapped.

## Registry and routing

Two registries separate configuration from live processes:

- [`ProviderInstanceRegistry`][instances] keys configured instances by `ProviderInstanceId`. Creating
  one looks up the driver by `driverKind`, decodes `entry.config` with that driver's schema, opens a
  child scope, and calls `driver.create`.
- [`ProviderAdapterRegistry`][registry] resolves an instance ID to its live adapter via
  `getByInstance`.

[`ProviderService`][service] sits on top. It combines the adapter registry with the provider session
directory to route session and turn operations for a thread, so callers name a thread, not an agent.

Adding a driver means writing the driver plus adapter and adding it to `BUILT_IN_DRIVERS`. No
orchestration, contract, or client change is required for the common case.

## How provider work is requested

Clients never call a provider directly. They dispatch orchestration commands over the RPC method
`orchestration.dispatchCommand`, defined with the rest of the orchestration surface in
[`orchestration.ts`][contracts]. The client-dispatchable provider-facing commands are
`thread.turn.start`, `thread.turn.interrupt`, `thread.approval.respond`,
`thread.user-input.respond`, `thread.checkpoint.revert`, and `thread.session.stop`, plus the mode
setters `thread.runtime-mode.set` and `thread.interaction-mode.set`.

The engine persists an event for the command, and a server-side reactor performs the provider call.
Provider output comes back as internal commands such as `thread.message.assistant.delta` and
`thread.session.set`, which clients observe through `orchestration.subscribeThread`. See
[overview.md](./overview.md) for the command/event loop.

## Server-side workers

Provider work flows through three queue-backed workers. All three are built with
`makeDrainableWorker` from [`DrainableWorker.ts`][worker] and expose `drain` for deterministic test
synchronization.

1. [`ProviderRuntimeIngestion`][ingest] consumes provider runtime streams and emits orchestration
   commands.
2. [`ProviderCommandReactor`][cmd] reacts to orchestration intent events and dispatches provider
   calls.
3. [`CheckpointReactor`][checkpoint] captures workspace checkpoints on turn start and completion, and
   performs reverts.

### Buffered assistant delivery

A thread in `buffered` assistant delivery mode accumulates assistant text instead of streaming each
delta. The buffer is not held until turn completion. In [`ProviderRuntimeIngestion`][ingest],
`MAX_BUFFERED_ASSISTANT_CHARS` is 24,000: the append that would exceed it invalidates the buffer and
spills the whole accumulated text as one delta. The buffer also flushes at interaction boundaries,
when a request opens (approval) or user input is requested, via
`flushBufferedAssistantMessagesForTurn`.

## Agent MCP tools

The server hosts an MCP endpoint at `/mcp` ([`McpHttpServer.ts`][mcp]) that every provider session
is pointed at as the `t3-code` server. A per-session bearer credential is minted in
[`ProviderService`][service] when the session starts, and it carries a set of capabilities decided
by settings: `preview` from `enableAgentBrowserAccess`, `orchestration` from
`enableAgentOrchestration`. No capability, no credential, no server attached. Each toolkit begins
by requiring its capability, so a preview-only credential cannot spawn sessions.

The `orchestration` toolkit ([`toolkits/orchestration`][orchestration]) exposes `session_spawn`,
`session_list`, and `session_wake`. They act only within the calling thread's project, read the
projection through `ProjectionSnapshotQuery`, and dispatch ordinary commands through the
orchestration engine with `server:orchestration-*` command ids. Spawn is `thread.create` followed
by `thread.turn.start` with no `titleSeed`, which is what keeps the title out of reach of
automatic titling. Wake is a bare `thread.turn.start`, which respawns a stopped provider process.

Threads carry an optional `group`. A spawned thread is created with one; the spawning thread stays
ungrouped, since one orchestrator drives many tickets. For any thread whose title matches
`SESSION_NAME_PATTERN` the command reactor passes `peerName` (the title) in
`ProviderSessionStartInput`; the Claude adapter forwards it as `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_NAME` on a
per-session copy of the environment, so the CLI registers under that name across restarts. Other
adapters ignore `peerName`.
